# Teruhbot
Teruhbot is a bot specifically designed for my friend group's Discord server; however, it is MIT licensed, so any of it's "modules" or features can be freely implemented in to your project!

## Dependencies
 - [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
	 - for Discord functionality
 - [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities)
	 - used as the command engine
 - [MySQL-Connector](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j)
 	 - used to user data for specific modules

## Building
This is primarily an Eclipse project. The Eclipse `.project` file is included in this repository, so you can simply import it through the Eclipse `> Import Existing Gradle Project...` tool after cloning.
